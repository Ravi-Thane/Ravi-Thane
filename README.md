## 🧪 How to Run Tests

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Run tests with Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean test
   ```

   or with Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

## 📝 Writing Tests

Test scenarios are written in Gherkin syntax and located under `src/test/resources/features`.  
Step definitions map to these scenarios and are implemented in Java under `src/test/java/stepdefinitions`.

Example:

```gherkin
Feature: Login functionality

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid username and password
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
```
